I am both interested in theoretical topics within bilingualism, psycholinguistics and language acquisition, as well as in developments within the field of applied statistics and data analysis. More specifically, I like conducting psycholinguistic experiments to study bilingual first language acquisition, and I am enthusiastic about increasing the robustness of results by means of multi-method studies and research synthesis. 

Currently, I am conducting my PhD research within the [MultiCUE project](https://www.multicue.nl/). My PhD research focuses on the pragmatic communication abilities of multilingual children. I will investigate whether these abilities differ from those of monolingual peers, and what the mechanisms are that underlie such differences.
