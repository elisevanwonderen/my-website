abstract: Despite the often-reported finding that multilingual children may temporarily possess less advanced lexical or grammatical skills in at least one of their languages than monolingual peers, recent studies have found that exposure to multiple languages benefits children's pragmatic development. To assess the generalizability of these findings, we conducted a meta-analysis of 29 studies that investigated various pragmatic abilities in both multilingual and monolingual chil­ dren. In addition, we classified the investigated pragmatic abilities into three broad categories: (i) sensitivity to non-verbal information, (ii) understanding non-literal language, and (iii) informa­ tiveness in referencing. We found no effect of multilingualism on pragmatic abilities overall and also not in any of the categories separately. However, based on visual inspection of the effect sizes, we cannot rule out that multilingual children sometimes rely more on non-verbal cues during communication compared to their monolingual peers. We recommend future studies to formulate and test more specific hypotheses and to move away from the focus on a multilingual advantage.
